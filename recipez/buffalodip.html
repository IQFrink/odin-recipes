    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Saute the Garlic.</b> To saute the garlic, mince it and add it to the
        hot oil. You only want to cook it for about 15 seconds or until it
        becomes fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Melt the Cream Cheese, Buffalo Sauce, and Ranch.</b> Add the cubed
        cream cheese, buffalo sauce, and ranch dressing to the skillet with the
        garlic. Decrease the heat to medium-low, and cook for about 10 minutes,
        whisking frequently, until the cream cheese completely melts.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Mix in the Chicken and Cheddar.</b> Add shredded chicken and cheddar
        cheese to the saucepan; mix and stir until well blended. Continue to
        cook until heated through, and the cheese is melted.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Serve.</b>Pour the finished dip into a serving bowl. Garnish it with
        blue cheese crumbles and parsley, and serve.
