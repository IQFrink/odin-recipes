The Odin Project recipes project

My name is Jacob Howard. I currently am sales support at a local lumber company in Kansas City, MO. I hope you learn enough from TOP to help me transition into a webdev/software dev role within the next year or so. I hope you learn enough from this program to confident in my ability to create anything I can dream up.

I'd like to have a good understanding of HTML an CSS syntax, as well as grasp the ins and outs of Git.

I'd like to learn enough to run with code instead of require direction.
